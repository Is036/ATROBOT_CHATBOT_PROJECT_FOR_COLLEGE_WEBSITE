</br>A chatbot is a software application used to conduct an on-line chat conversation via text or text-to-speech, in lieu of providing direct contact with a live human agent.
</br>Here is a very basic chatbot utlising the Python's NLTK library.It's a very simple bot with hardly any cognitive skills.
</br>A Text file is given as an input where the information related to college is stored. The chatbot uses stored Data to answers the questions asked by the users.
